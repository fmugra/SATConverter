The colours graph format is an easy to use, human readable format to store undirected graphs with coloured vertices in text files (.clr extension).
It is fairly similar (though not compatible) to the DIMACS format found here: http://prolland.free.fr/works/research/dsat/dimacs.html

It works as follows:
- every line starting with "c" is a comment, comment lines can appear anywhere in the file
- first non-comment line is the "problem line" and reads "p cols <numVertices> <numEdges> <numColours>"
- edges are specified in a line "e <vertex1> <vertex2>"; edge lines can appear anywhere below the problem line
- vertex colours are specified in a line "v <vertex> <colour>"; colour lines can appear anywhere below the problem line
